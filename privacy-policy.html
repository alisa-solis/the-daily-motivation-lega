<h1>Privacy Policy for The Daily Motivation</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 28, 2025</p>

<p>The Daily Motivation ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use The Daily Motivation mobile application (the "App").</p>

<p>By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect limited information necessary to enable in-app purchases and personalized functionality. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A unique user identifier (User ID) generated upon sign-in via Apple or Google</li>
  <li>Transaction identifiers and credit usage data for verifying purchases and enabling paid features</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is securely stored using Firebase and is not shared with third parties for advertising, analytics, or tracking purposes.</p>

<p>All affirmation-related data (generated or saved) is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device and not transmitted externally.</p>

<h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Affirmations generated or saved by you remain on your device. You have full control over them and can delete them at any time within the app.</p>

<h3>2.1. Automatic Cleanup of Generated Affirmations</h3>
<p>To ensure smooth app performance, if the number of generated affirmations exceeds <strong>250</strong>, the app will automatically delete all but the <strong>most recent</strong> affirmation. This process happens <strong>locally</strong> on your device and does not involve any external data transmission or storage.</p>

<h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
<p>Since no personal data is stored externally, no retention of user data occurs on our part. All data resides on your device and is removed when the app is deleted.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This includes any unused credits and generated affirmations. Once the app is deleted, this data cannot be recovered.</p>

<h2>4. In-App Purchases and Credits</h2>
<p>When you purchase credits or a subscription, we store the transaction ID and related data to verify the purchase and provide you with access to paid features. This data is linked to your user account but is not shared with third parties.</p>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> store or access your payment card information. All transactions are securely processed through the App Store.</p>

<p>Your credit balance is tied to your account and may persist between sessions, but will not be restored if the app is deleted unless you sign in with the same account.</p>

<h2>5. Age Restriction</h2>
<p>The Daily Motivation is designed for general audiences and is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Because we do not store personal data, all management of data is done by you directly on your device. You can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View or delete your saved affirmations manually within the app.</li>
  <li>Delete the app to permanently remove all local data, including saved affirmations and unused credits. Reinstalling the app will <strong>not</strong> restore this data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes to our data handling practices. Updates will be posted in the app or on our website.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at:<br>
