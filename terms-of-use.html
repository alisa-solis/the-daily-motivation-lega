  <h1>Terms of Use for The Daily Motivation</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 23, 2025</p>

  <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of The Daily Motivation mobile application (the "App"), operated by The Daily Motivation ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By accessing or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.</p>

  <h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
  <p>The App allows you to generate and save affirmations. All content you create stays on your device and is not stored or transmitted to our servers. You are solely responsible for the content you generate and must ensure it complies with these Terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the App in a respectful and lawful manner. You must <strong>not</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit prompts or content that contain <strong>hate speech</strong>, <strong>discrimination</strong>, <strong>threats</strong>, or <strong>sexually explicit</strong> material;</li>
    <li>Use the App to generate harmful, misleading, or offensive content;</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, modify, or exploit the App or its features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Violation of these guidelines may result in restricted access to the App.</p>

  <h2>4. Local Data and Device Storage</h2>
  <p>All data related to your affirmations, preferences, and credits is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device. We do not collect or store any personal information beyond what is necessary to verify purchases and provide access to paid features.</p>
  <p>To ensure smooth performance, if the number of generated affirmations exceeds <strong>250</strong>, the App will automatically delete all but the <strong>most recent</strong> affirmation. This cleanup occurs locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>5. Deletion of the App</h2>
  <p>If you uninstall the App, all your data — including unused credits and generated affirmations — will be <strong>permanently deleted</strong>. This data <strong>cannot be recovered</strong> once the App is removed from your device.</p>

  <h2>6. Age Restriction</h2>
  <p>You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use the App. By using it, you affirm that you meet this age requirement.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>We may revise these Terms occasionally. If we make material changes, we will notify users through the App or on our website.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or need support, please contact us at:<br>
